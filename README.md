# Sample Web API + Service applications using RabbitMQ built with .NET Core.

In order to start the application type the following commands:

```
cd scripts
./docker-run.sh
```

Or simply _dotnet run_ projects separately and make sure that [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) is running as a service.

Reporter API will be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)  and Reports Service at [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050).
